I've created an app for [Magister]\(it's for schedule to check their homework and stuff) and wanted to make some money on it. So first I just implemented _interstitial ads_ right away. I think that was one of the most stupid things I've done so far with an app. I got some hate comments and mails with "Way did you do that" or "It's getting worser every update" and so on...

I started thinking what was smart to implement, because I just wanted to make at least some money without irritating anyone.  
So I've came to the conclusion to only show ads on days when people are free, like saturday or sunday and simply only just a banner as item in your agenda. 

**Conclusion:**
I think developer just don't think enough about using advertisment smart, when I look at the app-game industry I always see people just placing it so annoying that there is or a sneaky way you click on it or you just have to click on it to get some more coins or unlock a character. Guys I know you want to make money on your games but just think about it and that you annoy your own source of income. 
Just show ads as an in-game item or just interstitial after playing it at least 4 times not after every game...

I hope you like my first blog post! Let me know on [Twitter] what you think about it!
